This module creates four content types:

Election Season
Election Event
District
Ballot Items

Election seasons can contain one or more election events

Election Events can contain one or more Districts

Districts can contain one or more sub-districts and/or one or more Ballot Items

Ballot Items have an arbitrary number of 'choices'.


Content entry is done at at the District Level.

All available Ballot Items can have their results entered by users with the 'change election results' permission at each district.

The javascript api returns metadata as described in the requirements; with the addition that at the district level all results for ballot items (summed up recursively) are also returned.
